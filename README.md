Trail BlazerReloaded is a totally rebuilt version of the TrailBlazer Movie Trailer downloader for the Media Browser project.

The main aim of this project is to rebuild and extend the functionality of the original project, with more maintainable code, along with support for a number of additional providers other than HD-Trailers.net.

Current Status
--------------

This project is currently under initial development, and as such working functionality is still minimal.
